# Smart Trash Bin - BinGenious

**An Intelligent Waste Container**

## Overview

The **Smart Trash Bin** is an innovative Arduino project designed to revolutionize waste disposal. Combining advanced hardware functionality with a user-friendly app, it offers a hygienic, efficient, and interactive solution for modern waste management. The bin automatically detects hand motion to open the lid, monitors fill levels in real time using sensors and LED indicators, and provides visual feedback through an LCD display. Additionally, the accompanying Flutter-based mobile app enables users to monitor the binâ€™s status, earn gamification rewards, and receive notifications, making waste management more engaging and sustainable.

**Start Date:** October 8, 2024  
**Duration:** 3 months  
**Status:** Ongoing

## Features

### **Hardware**
- **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04):** Detects motion to trigger the automatic lid opening, enhancing hygiene.
- **IR Sensors:** Measure fill levels, detecting when the bin is 0%, 50%, or 100% full.
- **Motorized Lid Mechanism:** Enables hands-free lid operation.
- **LCD Display (16x2):** Displays real-time bin fill levels.
- **Speaker/Buzzer:** Provides audio feedback and plays a melody as a gesture of gratitude.

### **Software**
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Displays bin fill level, syncs with hardware sensors, and notifies users when thresholds are met.
- **Authentication:** Secure login system powered by Firebase for user data protection.
